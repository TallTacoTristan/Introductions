I'm Dylan Hook, a coder who created EdgenTweaks to make Edgenuity easier to use and added features to Initium. 
For three years, Iâ€™ve inspired coders to build scripts like EdgyPro, Revolt, and EdgeBolt, which borrow my ideas for automation and smoother interfaces. 
I love helping students and coders by making tech simpler and sparking creativity in the community. 
Have a great day!
